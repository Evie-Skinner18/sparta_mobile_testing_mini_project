# Mini Project 27th June: Automated Mobile App Testing

## How to run the program
1. Clone this repository to your machine by downloading the zip folder
2. Extract the contents of the zip folder
3. Open your Terminal and navigate into the appium_mini_project directory
4. Ensure you have Appium and Android Studio installed on your machine
5. Run the command ``cucumber``

## What has Been Tested?
The most high-priority functions of the app have been tested first: I decided that these are the ability of the user to open the app, add a new text note and add a new checklist. Thereafter, the next highest priority cases were the user's ability to edit their text note, and add or delete items from their checklist.



## Tools and Technologies
- This automated test framework has been built using Selenium WebDriver and the Appium server. I have written the use cases for my tests in Gherkin syntax with Cucumber as my test runner.
- I have used Android Studio to help me run the tests, by using the device emulator which simulates the application running on an Android device and operating system of my choosing.
- The emulator I have used throughout the project is the Nexus 6P, using Android Oreo.
